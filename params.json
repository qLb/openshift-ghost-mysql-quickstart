{"name":"Openshift-ghost-mysql-quickstart","tagline":"Ghost QuickStart for OpenShift using MySQL","body":"This is a fork of [the original ghost quickstart available on openshift](https://github.com/openshift-quickstart/openshift-ghost-quickstart). It is a basic quickstart to get Ghost running on OpenShift. It uses MySQL as a database instead of SQLite3. It has been updated from Ghost 0.5 to 0.5.7.\r\n\r\nTo install it from the command line make sure you have the latest rhc gem installed and then run the following command: replacing 'ghost' if you want your app to be named something else\r\n\r\n\trhc app create ghost nodejs-0.10 mysql-5.5 --env NODE_ENV=production --from-code https://github.com/lemur3/openshift-ghost-mysql-quickstart.git\r\n\r\n'ghost' will be the name of your application in the above example.\r\n\r\nNote these OpenShift specific changes carried over from the original quickstart:\r\n\r\n1. The content/data and content/images directories have been removed.  They are created on the server and symlinked to your $OPENSHIFT\\_DATA\\_DIR so that posts and uploaded images will persist across 'git pushes'\r\n2. Even though the node.js cartridge itself is scalable, this application will not play nice with scaling right now because the images are stored on disk, and since OpenShift does not currently support shared physical disk storage across scaled gears, this cartridge will not scale.\r\n4. Upon completion of the install you'll want to use a secure connection to https://yourappname-yourdomain.rhcloud.com/ghost/ in order to set up your administrator account. You may get a blank page if you connect to http://.\r\n5. If you use a custom domain, modify the \"url:\" field in the 'production' section of the config.js file, it should look something like: \r\n\turl: 'http://www.example.com',\r\n(with the comma at the end)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nVisit the [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) Github for more information and to get involved. \r\n\r\n![Ghost Screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/120485/4828504/9e832764-5f80-11e4-8ac1-0332bcc67a35.png)\r\n\r\nGhost is a free, open, simple blogging platform that's available to anyone who wants to use it.
